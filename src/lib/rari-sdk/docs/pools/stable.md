# Rari SDK: Stable Pool

The SDK's `Rari.pools.stable` object includes `web3.eth.Contract` objects for each contract as well as wrapper methods and constants for easy implementation.

## **Wrapper APIs**

The following wrapper APIs are available via the `pools.stable` object:

- `pools.stable.apy`: See [**Stable Pool APY**](#stable-pool-apy) section below.
- `pools.stable.balances`: See [**My USD Balance and Interest**](#my-usd-balance-and-interest) and [**Total Supply and Interest**](#total-supply-and-interest) sections below.
- `pools.stable.deposits`: See [**Deposits**](#deposits) section below.
- `pools.stable.withdrawals`: See [**Withdrawals**](#withdrawals) section below.
- `pools.stable.rspt`: See [**RSPT (Rari Stable Pool Token)**](#rspt-rari-stable-pool-token) section below.
- `pools.stable.fees`: See [**Fees on Interest**](#fees-on-interest) section below.
- `pools.stable.allocations`: See [**Raw Allocations**](#raw-allocations) and [**Internal Stablecoin Pricing**](#internal-stablecoin-pricing) sections below.
- `pools.stable.history`: See [**Historical Data**](#historical-data) section below.

The wrapper APIs use [BN.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js) for large integer support. Most SDK wrapper methods accept `BN` instances as parameters and return BN instances as well. You can find BN.js available at `Rari.BN`.

Note that many of the API methods rely on `pools.stable.cache`. You can modify the cache timeouts (in seconds) via `pools.stable.cache._raw["key"].timeout`.

## **Raw Smart Contract APIs**

All smart contracts are available under `pools.stable.contracts` as [`web3.eth.Contract` objects](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html). The following `Contract` objects are available:

- `pools.stable.contracts.RariFundController`: Holds Rari Stable Pool funds and is used by the rebalancer to deposit and withdraw from pools and make exchanges.
- `pools.stable.contracts.RariFundManager`: The Rari Stable Pool's main contract: it handles deposits, withdrawals, USD balances, interest, fees, etc.
- `pools.stable.contracts.RariFundToken`: The Rari Stable Pool Token (RSPT) is an ERC20 token used to internally account for ownership of assets under management (AUM).
- `pools.stable.contracts.RariFundPriceConsumer`: Retrieves stablecoin prices from Chainlink's public price feeds (used by `RariFundManager` and `RariFundController`).
- `pools.stable.contracts.RariFundProxy`: Includes wrapper functions built on top of `RariFundManager`: exchange and deposit, withdraw and exchange, deposit without paying gas via the Gas Station Network (GSN).

See [`API.md` of the `rari-contracts` repository](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/rari-contracts/blob/master/API.md) for a full reference on the contracts' raw functions. As for the standard ERC20 token functions available in `contracts.RariFundToken.methods` (like `totalSupply`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`, etc.), see [EIP-20: ERC-20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) for reference on common functions of ERC20 tokens like RSPT.

Note that you can access deployed contract addresses at `Contract.options.address`. See [the web3.js documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html) for more information on `web3.eth.Contract` objects. Use [`Contract.methods.myMethod.call(options)`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-call) when reading data and [`Contract.methods.myMethod.send(options)`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-send) when changing the state. Note that the `options` object is optional when using `call`, and the `from` parameter is required in the `options` object when using `send`.
