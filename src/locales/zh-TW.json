  "This chart is generated using the APYs of each pool (shown at the bottom of this page). It introduces a random variance in the APY each day, with a max of 2x the current pool APY, and a minimum of 0% APY. It does not account for large changes in APY (greater than 2x), divergence loss in the Yield Pool, or take into account ETH price. The ETH Pool simulation is not denominated in ETH, instead it simulates returns on USD using the current APY of the ETH Pool. In the ETH pool you are exposed to the price movements of ETH (which is not shown or accounted for in this simulation).": "該圖表是使用每個池的APY生成的（顯示在此頁面的底部）。 它每天在APY中引入隨機方差，最大2倍於當前池APY，最小0％APY。 它不考慮APY的較大變化（大於2倍），收益池中的背離損失或不考慮ETH價格。 ETH池模擬不是以ETH計價，而是使用ETH池的當前APY模擬美元的收益。 在ETH池中，您會面臨ETH的價格變動（在此模擬中未顯示或未說明）。",
